Decennial 2010 PL94-171 (Redistricting)
=======================================

These SQL files were made with search/replace methods, so there is no scripted process to recreate them. 

The "geoheader" SQL scripts were created using census2010_geo_schema.csv, originally obtained from the [`wireservice/ffs` repository](https://github.com/wireservice/ffs/blob/master/us/census/census2010_geo_schema.csv).

The sequence file import SQL scripts were created using the `pl_part1_2010.sas` and `pl_part2_2010.sas` files from https://www2.census.gov/census_2010/01-Redistricting_File--PL_94-171/
